# Human-pose-detection-using-mediapipe

Pose estimation refers to computer vision techniques that detect human figures in images and video, so that one could determine, for example, where someone’s elbow shows up in an image.
This project implements a real-time human pose detection system using MediaPipe and OpenCV. It detects and tracks human body landmarks from images, videos and also in real time by the help of webcam , enabling accurate posture and movement analysis. The system processes frames efficiently to achieve smooth, real-time performance.


# 🎯 Objectives

~ Detect full-body human poses in real time

# Technologies Used

~ Programming Language: Python

~ Libraries & Frameworks:

MediaPipe (Pose Estimation)
OpenCV (Computer Vision)
NumPy (Numerical Processing)
Matplotlib (Plot creation)
